Priest-Magician,

I felt I should let you know that I cleaned your study as instructed, but it seems like the book you mentioned was missing. The one housing the cursing spell. There was a fair amount of dust in the room, so perhaps someone thought it was abandoned, or maybe it was simply stolen.

I am unsure how to go about finding it if it has gone missing. Hopefully the thief doesn’t plan to get up to too much mischief.

Dear Apprentice,

I appreciate your message, but I do not believe you understand the gravity of the situation. That book is not simply a single curse spell. The spell I am concerned about allows one to see a person’s ren. If they were to use this curse spell indiscriminately, the consequences could be disastrous.

These consequences fall to not only the victims, but the thief, as well as us.

Respected Seer,

I felt I should thank you for getting to our home so quickly. When our son started to cough, and then his head began to feel hotter, I knew that we should seek help from the gods through you.

Unfortunately, this message does not come with he same positive sentiments. Our daughter, who was present at the time, seems to have come under a different illness. We took her to some relatives who told us that her symptoms are in line with a curse. Specifically one in the shape of misused ren.

Our daughter said that the assistant you brought that day looked at her in a strange way. I do not wish to place blame, but am simply passing along what I have been told.
