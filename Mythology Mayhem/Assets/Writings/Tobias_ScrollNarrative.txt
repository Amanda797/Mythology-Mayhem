Philona,

I am deeply concerned for Rhodope’s son. Ever since she fell ill I have seen the child run off into the library at odd hours of the night. I don’t know what kind of activities he is up to, but I plan to tell him that he is welcome in our house should anything get…worse.

She falls sicker by the passing day. What a toll that must take on her poor son.

Head Librarian,

I was following what I believed to be a cat in the library. I did not see it, but when I rounded the corner, I saw small footprints. There was a child in the forbidden section of the library! The footprints collected around the recorded Greek spells on necromancy. Unfortunately, Petsis has not reached this section in his campaign to reorganize the scrolls, so we cannot know if the child stole any or not.

Philona,

I spoke again today with the physician. He told me that Rhodope’s condition has been worsening, as we had expected. He is still unsure even of what it could be. She was given basic treatments that would improve her chances, but at this point she has been told to pray and wait for grace from the gods.

Head Librarian,

The child was here again today. I caught a glimpse of him running down the hall. He looked frail, starved. I know this disease has been tearing families apart, disrupting normal lives for everyone, but this chaos cannot be brought into the library. I will try to catch him the next time he sneaks in here.

Hopefully he doesn’t already have what he needs. I fear he may anger the gods if he meddles in these things he does not understand. If it comes to it, we may need to follow the child and retrieve the knowledge he has taken before it is mistreated and lost forever.
