Boars used for sacrifices

Dolon,

The yields of our farms have taken a hit this year. The priests tell us that we must have somehow angered Demeter in some way. I do not believe that our normal sacrifice will not do for this year.
Tell Hylas to fetch some men together and go search for a boar. It must be alive. If the fool kills the boar, tell him to find another and bring it back in one piece.

Boar got loose in cities

Cleades,

I swear I tell the truth! It was big as a bear, snarling and gnashing it’s teeth. The tusks looked like antlers and the eyes were a blood-red. I think the Calydonian boar had a brother, just as mad and strong as the first.
I am no Meleager, but it has to be done. It was dangerously close to the city, and I won’t allow any more Greeks to fall to beasts. Contact any hunters you know, maybe that Hylas, and tell them to meet me at my home in the coming days.

Historical boar hunts

If we are going to take this monster down, I think we should study how the heroes defeated the great Calydonian. To avoid another calamity, we will divvy up the rewards for the boar ahead of time, then reconvene after the hunt and determine whether the allocations are fair.

Even though she did not deal the final blow, a woman accompanied the heroes on this hunt, and she scored the first strike against the boar. We may want to bring a woman archer, as well as make a sacrifice to Artemis beforehand so that we may find success in this endeavor.
