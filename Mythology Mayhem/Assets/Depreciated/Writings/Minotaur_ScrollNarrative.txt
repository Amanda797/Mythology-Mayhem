Lysis,

I hope you are doing well.

Something has happened here in Crete. The people worry for the kingdom and the throne. Queen Pasiphae appeared to be soon to bear a child, perhaps even a successor to King Minos, but the queen has not been seen for much time.
Some have even said that the child has already died, citing some kind of betrayal to Poseidon.

Now, they build some sort of great structure, the thing is truly massive, a labyrinth of sorts. At night, people hear a roaring coming from that place, and I do not know what is real or not here anymore. Hopefully King Minos is well, and the Queen’s new son or daughter grows up to be strong.

The Athenians have far overstepped. King Minos will not be challenged on his demands.

We will sail on the Athenians and rain the Gods’ wrath upon them, forcing them to submit. For taking the King’s son for no better reason than jealousy and shame. They will see what they have wrought and weep tears, as they will pay this tax for generations to come.

They stand no chance in war, or against disease. If they do not agree to hand over seven boys and girls of the highest standard, they will not live to see another decade.

We did not know what King Minos had in store for the children from Athens, but I must continue to believe that the King’s son looks down on us with a victorious smile.

The roaring seems to have gone silent. We pray that whatever beast lies within the labyrinth is sated with Athenian flesh and blood. The third ship of Athenians arrived just yesterday, but the screams have already faded. I suppose the beast made quick work out of them this time.
