Today I went deep into the forest looking for good tinder for our fires, but I tripped on something that was sticking out from the ground. I got back home and asked mother about it, and she told me that it was for practicing seiðr.
She said that it must’ve been from some old lady a long time ago, but when I told her that it looked like it had just been made her face turned really serious. I wonder what that was about.

Svein,

I implore you to give me some time with my son. I understand he has been involving himself with seiðr. His understanding of ergi is flawed. Within the coming months you should see him become a dependable warrior worthy of joining the warband.

I fondly remember the battles we shared when we were younger. I hope he takes after young Einar and puts the warrior blood running through his veins to use, as we did.

Seið-kona,

There have been some reports of young Gorm peeking in on your teachings. If you should see him there, report it to me immediately. Perhaps we can still salvage some of his manhood and warrior spirit.

As you know, the boy will be branded with this forever if he continues to practice shaman magics. Try to keep quiet about this. If his father were to find out, he may not live through the winter.

It is my belief that Gorm has taken up seiðr in fear of the coming battles. Unsure of the future, he has chosen to fight his battles before they are fought, in a way. I respect my son’s intentions, but ultimately know that he will be cast from this house if it continues.

Perhaps if his father can stir the warrior spirit in him, he can be allowed to enter the warband with the rest of the boys when the time comes.
