I did not want to be a priest. I had wanted to become like my father, a farmer, and take over his job once he was too old to perform it. Villac umu decided that I was to become one, and my family was so pleased and eager to hear the news and send me to train for ceremonies.

Even though I knew it was a great honor to be chosen, it had felt like my life, my path of life, was ripped from me instantly because someone said so.
 
Because there isnâ€™t any evidence that the Incas ever met the Aztecs, the rest of these are going off of the idea that Micos made his own written Incan language.

I have accompanied the villac umu on his meetings with traders from civilizations outside the empire. It seems that these people have some sort of written language, which is forbidden in our culture. Why is that? It would be so much easier for many people to see what you are trying to say at once. Quipu seems ridiculous compared to this.

In secret I have started my own written version of the Quechua language. I believe the gods will understand. Even though I must make and use it in secret now, perhaps when I am a respected umu, or even villac umu, I can convince the people to record our history this way, and then nothing will be lost to time.
