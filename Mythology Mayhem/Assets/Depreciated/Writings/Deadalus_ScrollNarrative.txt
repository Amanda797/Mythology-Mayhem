I fear that I have endangered both my own life and that of my son. Though it was a great honor to serve the King and make his castle a reality, that kind of trust has had an unfortunate consequence.
If only it weren’t for the contraption I had made. It sickens me just to think on it now.

What was I supposed to do? It was a request from the queen, and if I had gone to King Minos about it, he would have me killed on the spot just for knowing! How was I to know that the gods would punish the King in this way? How was I to know that I was to be used as a puppet for Poseidon’s wrath?

I have locked the beast in the labyrinth. It pains me to hear its cries every night, but I know deeply that this punishment is not of my doing. If Poseidon wanted King Minos to pay in this way, it would have been done regardless.
My son tells me that he suffers night terrors. No doubt a symptom of the cries of the monster late at night invading his dreams. How I wish someone would just slay the beast and be done with it.

The young Ariadne came to me this evening, under cover of darkness. Her father certainly doesn’t know that we spoke.
How hard it has been to know the structure I built has not only been the source of torment for the forbidden child of the Queen, but to know that fourteen other children have met their end, no doubt riddled with fear, from the labyrinth.

I should have consulted Icarus on the matter, but the price had weighed too heavy on my head. I gifted the girl a long piece of string, allowing the children to find their way from the maze. She also said that the boy had smuggled in a sword, so perhaps the child can finally free us all from this curse.
